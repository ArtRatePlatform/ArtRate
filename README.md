# ArtRate
Art Rate is an NFT Marketplace where artists can convert their Artworks into NFTs and sell them. Moreover, by using our social media platform they are able to get in touch and connect with other artists from all around the world who share common interests. 
Here they are also able to gain more knowledge and read the latest news and developments around their area of interest by using a section called Wiki that uses text mining algorithms (implemented in our systems) that search through the internet and big data banks and find related topics.

# Solution
Our goal is to develop an application so that we can integrate this service with DAO's ecosystem. We look at our users as creators of data and we want to convert these data into NFTs.
# Features
"Social media:"  where artists can create their own space or team up with other artists from all around the world with different backgrounds and give detailed explanations of their projects and use different tags so others can find them more easily.

"NFT Marketplace:" A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital asset that is different from each other by original identification codes and metadata. Moreover, an NFT Marketplace is a place and a unique chance for Art Rate to showcase individual intellectuals and creative collectibles and exhibit those items to promote effective handling of digital assets.

"NFT Generator:"  This service generates artworks as a collection. The type and the format of the file is not important. Our Token Generator must be able to generate and convert digital arts into NFTs. There are some scenarios that must be considered that they depend on the file format of the artwork. The artist has to choose a scenario when generating a collection or the service chooses it automatically.

"AI & Machine Learning:" Using different types of Machine Learning Algorithms and Technologies
